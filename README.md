Suggested improvements:
you can create an undo function to make gameflow smoother and fuck ups easier to fix
you can change the dimensions when building the GUI. 
  change the dimensions from absolute values to values relative to the screen the progrma is being run on.
   use dimension.get() type functions and set dimensions to x/2, y/4, ...
   also use pack() to avoid overlapping with different size screens if you pack and use the screen dimensions to build the GUI, this can be run on any screen
   and it will adapt to the screen its on
